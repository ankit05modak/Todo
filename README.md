## How it started?
I am learning Django web framework. After completing a course on django, I started to build a user management system which would let an user sign in, sign off, register new user, change passoword, reset password, etc. 
As I completed the required user management system, I felt why not build something which is user centric, so I build a task manager on top of that (Ofcourse by watching youtube videos but I have understood the complete functionality behind it)


## Current completions.
1. Built a user management system.  (login , logout, register, reset pass, forgot pass)
2. User centric tasks can be created, updated and destroyed.
3. Users are able to see only their created tasks.


## To be added. (My thoughts, feel free to help me. Your thoughs are always appreciated!)
1. Not able to implement actual email send functionality.
2. Once the tasks are completed, they need to be deleted from the database.
3. Style can be upgraded. (Not so much good with it yet.)


## Thankyou.
